# Estimate-Final-Cost-of-Labor-Project-with-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

# Project Objectives:
First we gather an initial estimate of days and daily cost for project tasks based on hourly wage rate, number of workers, quantiy of work to perform, labor production rate, standard deviation, and working hours per day. 

After the initial estimate we use those parameters, along with a specificed simulation count, to model different working scenarios that result in different production rates. The varying production rates will directly effect final task costs and overall project cost.

This simulation is relevant due to the difficulty of acheieving consistant production rates on a construction project. Any factor of items can effect daily rates. Examples include, other trades interfering with your work area, not enough material, bad weather, and material not close enough to work area. The resulting statistics can be helpful in budgeting for various project costs. Furthermore, using the outputted mean and standard deviation can provide confidence and structure to project estimates and or budgeting exercises.
